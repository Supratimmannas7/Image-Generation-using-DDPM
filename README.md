Image Generation using DDPM

This project focuses on image generation using  Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), with the code and dataset sourced from GitHub. By utilizing diffusion processes to iteratively refine noise into coherent images, we aim to  capture  intricate  details  and  textures  across  various  datasets.  The  model  is  trained  on collection of  images,  allowing  it   to  learn  complex  distributions  and  produce  visually   appealing  outputs.  My  findings   demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  DDPM   in generating realistic  images,  showcasing  their  potential applications in areas such as art, design, and data augmentation.
